=head1 NAME

MooX::Role::DBIConnection - handy mixin for objects with a DB connection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    { package My::Example;
      use Moo 2;
      with 'MooX::Role::DBIConnection';
    };

    # Lazily connect using the parameters
    my $writer = My::Example->new(
        dbh => {
            dsn  => '...',
            user => '...',
            password => '...',
            options => '...',
        },
    );

    # ... or alternatively if you have a connection already
    my $writer2 = My::Example->new(
        dbh => $dbh,
    );

This module enhances your class constructor by allowing you to pass in either
a premade C<dbh> or the parameters needed to create one.

The C<dbh> method will then return either the passed-in database handle or
try a connection to the database at the first use.

=head1 OPTIONS

The following options can be passed in the hashref to specify

=over 4

=item B<dsn>

L<DBI> dsn to connect to

=item B<user>

Database user to use when connecting to the database. This is the second
parameter used in the call to C<< DBI->connect(...) >>.

=item B<password>

Database password to use when connecting to the database. This is the third
parameter used in the call to C<< DBI->connect(...) >>.

=item B<options>

Database options to use when connecting to the database. This is the fourth
parameter used in the call to C<< DBI->connect(...) >>.

=item B<eager>

Whether to connect to the database immediately or upon the first call to the
the C<< ->dbh >>. The default is to make the connection lazily on first use.

sub BUILD( $self, $args ) {
    if( my $_dbh = delete $args->{dbh}) {
        $self->{_dbh_options} = $_dbh;
        if(ref $_dbh eq 'HASH' && $_dbh->{eager}) {
            $self->reconnect_dbh( $_dbh );
        };
    }
};

sub _connect_db( $self, $dbh ) {
    if( ref($dbh) eq 'HASH' ) {
        $dbh = DBI->connect( @{$dbh}{qw{dsn user password options}});
    }
    return $dbh
}

=head1 METHODS

The following methods are mixed in through this role:

=head2 C<< ->dbh >>

  my $dbh = $self->dbh;

Connects to the database if needed and returns the database handle

=cut

sub dbh( $self ) {
    return $self->{_dbh} //= $self->_connect_db( $self->{_dbh_options} );
}

=head2 C<< ->reconnect_dbh >>

  if( my $child = fork ) {
      ...
  } else {
      # in child process
      # We need a fresh database connection
      $self->reconnect_dbh;
  }

Opens a new database connection. If an old connection existed, it is
not closed.

=cut

sub reconnect_dbh( $self, $options = $self->{_dbh_options} ) {
    $self->{_dbh} = $self->_connect_db( $options )
}
